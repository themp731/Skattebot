## Understanding the Metrics

### **Power Score** (The Overall Ranking)
```
Power Score = (Real Wins × 2) + (Top6 Wins) + (MVP-W)
```
This is our ultimate measure of team quality. It heavily weights **actual matchup wins** (multiplied by 2) because winning is what matters most. But it also rewards teams that consistently score in the top half (**Top6 Wins**) and would beat multiple opponents each week (**MVP-W**).

### **MVP-W** (Minimized Variance Potential Wins)
Your theoretical win rate if you played **all teams in the league every single week**. High scorers have high MVP-W; low scorers don't.

### **WAX** (Wins Above Expectation)
```
WAX = Real Wins - MVP-W
```
- **Positive WAX** = Lucky (winning more than scoring deserves)
- **Negative WAX** = Unlucky (losing despite good scoring)
- **WAX near 0** = Getting exactly what you deserve
