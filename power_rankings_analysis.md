## Team-by-Team Analysis (With the Snark You Deserve)

### #1 MP - Power Score: 31.73
**Record: 8-2 | PPG: 121.44 | WAX: +0.27**

Congratulations, you're actually good. With 8 wins and the highest scoring average in the league, you're not just getting lucky—you're genuinely dominating. That +0.27 WAX means you've earned almost every win. The rest of the league is basically playing for second place at this point. Enjoy your inevitable championship and the awkward silence when you try to talk about your fantasy team at parties.

---

### #2 sgf - Power Score: 24.18
**Record: 6-4 | PPG: 112.89 | WAX: -0.18**

Solidly in second place, you're doing everything right: consistent top-6 finishes, decent wins, and you're actually *slightly* unlucky (-0.18 WAX). You're the tortoise to MP's hare, except the hare is already at the finish line and the tortoise is stuck in traffic. Still, you're legitimately good—just not good enough to catch the leader.

---

### #3 (Tied) KIRK - Power Score: 23.36
**Record: 5-5 | PPG: 111.27 | WAX: -1.36**

Oh, KIRK. You poor, unfortunate soul. You're scoring 111 PPG (third-highest in the league!), finishing in the top 6 seven times, and somehow you're sitting at 5-5. That -1.36 WAX is the league's worst luck—you should have 6-7 wins by now. You're the fantasy football equivalent of a talented actor who never gets nominated for an Oscar. Maybe next week schedule some easier opponents? Oh wait, that's not how this works.

---

### #3 (Tied) GV - Power Score: 23.36
**Record: 6-4 | PPG: 103.66 | WAX: +0.64**

Tied for third with KIRK, but let's be real—you're not the same. KIRK is unlucky and elite; you're lucky and good. That +0.64 WAX means you've stolen at least one win you didn't deserve. Your 103 PPG is middle-of-the-pack, but you're sitting pretty at 6-4 because the fantasy gods smiled upon you. Enjoy it while it lasts, because regression to the mean is coming for you.

---

### #5 ZSF - Power Score: 22.64
**Record: 5-5 | PPG: 111.25 | WAX: -0.64**

Another victim of bad luck with -0.64 WAX. You're scoring 111 PPG (fourth-best!), but sitting at .500 because apparently your opponents decided to have their best weeks against you. Seven top-6 finishes should translate to more wins, but the fantasy football scheduling algorithm clearly has it out for you. At least you can take solace in knowing you're better than your record suggests. Small victories, right?

---

### #6 PATS - Power Score: 21.55
**Record: 5-5 | PPG: 106.40 | WAX: -0.55**

The most inconsistent team in the league (4.09 rank standard deviation), you're either a hero or a zero each week. That -0.55 WAX suggests you're slightly unlucky, but honestly, with your week-to-week volatility, it's hard to tell if you're unlucky or just bad at setting your lineup. Six top-6 finishes mixed with some absolute stinkers. Maybe try checking the injury report before Sunday?

---

### #7 GEMP - Power Score: 19.00
**Record: 6-4 | PPG: 100.81 | WAX: +2.00**

Oh, GEMP. You beautiful, lucky bastard. You're ranked 7th in power but sitting at 6-4 because you have a league-leading +2.00 WAX. That means you've won TWO more games than your mediocre 100.81 PPG deserves. You're the kid who guesses on every test question and somehow passes. Enjoy your fraudulent record while it lasts—the fantasy gods giveth, and they definitely taketh away.

---

### #8 POO - Power Score: 18.45
**Record: 5-5 | PPG: 102.37 | WAX: +0.55**

A bit lucky (+0.55 WAX) but mostly just average. You're scoring 102 PPG in a 12-team league, which is... fine, I guess? Your power ranking suggests you're fighting for a playoff spot, and that's exactly where you belong—on the bubble, hoping for the best, preparing for mediocrity. The good news is you're not in last place. The bad news is that's the only good news.

---

### #9 ROUX - Power Score: 17.09
**Record: 4-6 | PPG: 96.72 | WAX: -0.09**

Barely unlucky, mostly just not good. That 96.72 PPG is third-worst in the league, and your 4-6 record reflects it. You've had five top-6 finishes somehow, which means you also had five bottom-6 finishes. Consistency is apparently not your strong suit. Neither is winning, apparently. Maybe next year will be your year? (Narrator: It won't be.)

---

### #10 KESS - Power Score: 17.09
**Record: 5-5 | PPG: 99.78 | WAX: +0.91**

The most consistent terrible team in the league (2.42 rank std dev), you somehow have 5 wins despite a pathetic 99.78 PPG. That +0.91 WAX means you're winning games you have no business winning. You're like the relief pitcher who keeps giving up runs but somehow gets credited with wins. The most consistent thing about you is your ability to consistently underperform while still stumbling into victories.

---

### #11 WOOD - Power Score: 12.36
**Record: 3-7 | PPG: 91.84 | WAX: -0.36**

Third-worst PPG (91.84), second-worst record (3-7), and you're even slightly unlucky (-0.36 WAX). That's impressive in all the wrong ways. You're not just bad—you're bad AND unfortunate. It's like watching someone trip on a banana peel and then get hit by a bus. At least you're slightly unlucky, so you can blame the universe instead of your terrible roster management?

---

### #12 3000 - Power Score: 9.18
**Record: 2-8 | PPG: 91.15 | WAX: -1.18**

Dead last. Basement dweller. The league's punching bag. You're scoring 91 PPG (worst in the league), you have 2 wins (also worst), and you're STILL unlucky (-1.18 WAX)! You should theoretically have 3 wins, but nope, even the universe has given up on you. You're so consistently bad (2.46 rank std dev) that opposing teams don't even bother checking scores—they just assume they won. 

The good news? You can only go up from here. The bad news? That's what you said last year.

---

## Final Thoughts

This league has: one elite team (MP), a cluster of above-average teams fighting for playoff spots, a bunch of lucky frauds (looking at you, GEMP), some genuinely unlucky squads (RIP KIRK), and absolute dumpster fires bringing up the rear (3000, we're still talking about you).

May the odds be ever in your favor. Or not. Based on these power rankings, most of you need more than luck—you need a miracle.
